## Info

This is a frontend to the bank-account validator written by
M. Malkusch, see [BAV Github
project](https://github.com/bav-php/bav). The actuall backend used,
however, is [my fork](https://github.com/rotdrop/bav.git) as
unfortunately the original Github repo is no longer maintained, it
seem.

BAV validates IBAN checksums by the known methods (using
[php-iban](https://github.com/globalcitizen/php-iban)) and using the
[BAV backend](https://github.com/bav-php/bav) it also validates the
contained bank-id and bank-account-id. The Deutsche Bundesbank
maintains a registry of banks and a registry of checksum algorithm for
validating a bank account id. The data-sets are publically available
and scraped from the web-pages of the Deutsche Bundesbank on a regular
bases and copied to the Nextcloud database in tables `bav_agency`,
`bav_bank` and `bav_meta` (the latter just contains the timestamp of
the last fetch, so you could consult the table in order to check when
the last update happened).

The Nextcloud BAV frontend is based on Vue and just display a small
dialog where bank account information can be entered. The BAV-app will
verify a given IBAN, extract the bank id and bank account id and
verify that the bank exists and then use the registered checksum
algoritm to validate also the account id.

Vice-versa, when entering bank id and bank-account id it will generate
the proper IBAN.

## Privacy and Security

- The bank data is submitted to the server running the Nextcloud
instance by POST request, that is it is secured by the server's SSL
encryption. If you use unsecure unencrypte HTTP connection
(i.e. http://... instead of https://..) then the data will not be
encrypted.

- The server then runs PHP scripts to validate and possibly complete
  the given (fractional) bank account data, however, it does not store
  those data.

- The web-frontend maintains an undo/redo stack, but this data is only
  stored in your web-browser. If you close the browser tab or window
  then also the undo-stack is gone.

## Testing

There are some German "dummy" IBANs which do not correspond to actual
bank accounts but pass the validation, e.g. `DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00`

## Building

Use PHP 8.5, Composer 2, Node.js 24, npm, GNU Make, `xpath`
(`libxml-xpath-perl` on Debian/Ubuntu), `rsync`, and `jq`:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
make appstore
```

The app-store target installs development tools for type generation and frontend
compilation, then removes root Composer development dependencies before
packaging without forwarding that removal to the Composer bin environments.
The shared build rules in `dev-scripts/lib` are a git submodule. The PHP toolkit
is installed through `composer-scoped.json` and isolated with PHP-Scoper into
`vendor-scoped`; there is no vendored `php-toolkit` checkout. The TypeScript
converter and its standalone Nextcloud API stubs are installed in
`vendor-bin/php-to-typescript`.
Run `make toolkit-l10n` after updating the toolkit and commit the generated
`l10n-sources/toolkit-strings.php` catalogue so translation extraction also sees
strings from the Composer package.
The unsigned archive is written to
`build/artifacts/appstore/`; signing is skipped when no signing key is available.

The Build app-store package workflow runs these steps on pushes and pull
requests, and can also be started manually. It verifies the archive's runtime
autoloading and asset manifest, then uploads the package as a workflow artifact.
